##EC2
- AMI can be copied, and they can also be shared across multiple AWS accounts
- AMI can also be copied from one availability region to another
- EBS backed or instance storage. EBS can be attached or detached to an instance- Instance storage is ephemeral, data is lost when instance is terminated
- spot instances Let you bid on unused instances. Amazon can take the spot instances away anytime
- on demand instance
- EC2- classic limits: 20 instances per account; 5 Elastic IP addresses. These can be increased by contacting AWS
- EC2 uses ECC memories
- Differences in instances: memory, compute power, block storage, network performance and EBS optimization
- If instance is off state, then you only pay for data storage

- When EC2-Classic is created, an IP address is assigned. This IP address can change when you start or stop the instance
- When EC2-Classic is created, an CNAME is assigned. This CNAME can change when you start or stop the instance
- You can setup an elastic IP address to maintain your IP address. This can be attached/detached to EC2
- EC2-Clasic is deprecated
- Termination protection can be used to avoid accidental termination

- Default SDK region is US-EAST-1
- Different storages:
  * s3, instance storage volume and EBS (/dev/sda1) : EBS are network attached storage 
  * instance storage is instance attached storage
  *
  * EBS can be attached only to 1 instance
  * volumes do not need to be un-mouted to take snapshots
  * atleast 1GB, and max of 1TB of EBS
  * EBS RAID 0 for redundancy
  * prewarming EBS: when EBS is reattached to EC2, EBS is erased on first mount causing loss of 5 to 50% OPS firs time. Prewarming can be used to avoid this.
  * EBS snapshots can be taken, they can be incremental

- Availability zones are physically separate and do not share generators, coolers etc .

- reserved instances: pay upfront to get guranteed compute 
- reserved instances cannot be moved to another region
- reserved instances can be modified: move to another availability zone, convert the type of instance to larger or smaller size within same family ex convert 8 m1.small to 4 m1.medium etc ..


- ELB allows to distribute traffic to available instances. Automatically stops traffic to unhealthy instance. 
- SSL certificates can be setup on ELB.  
- Maintaining session state when using ELB
- session will be saved on individual instance. But if there are multiple instances load balanced, then session can be lost
  * Enable ELB cookie stickiness or application generated stickyness
  * Database or memcache can be used to solve the session problem as well in case of elasticache
  * Elasticache with memcache is the recommended way to sovle the cookie prolem. 
  * When using elasticache, ELB works truly like ELB and not route all traffic to few instances based on cookies
