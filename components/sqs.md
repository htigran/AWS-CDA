##SQS Simple Queue Service
- Loosely decouples the resources
- it is a scalable messaging system
- Queues are used to store messages that travel between different components of architecture
- each queue can have unlimited messages, and you can create unlimited queues
- components are called workers, thy keep polling the queue
- allows individual resource to scale up based on load
- SQS guarantees delivery atleast once. So there can me more than 1 duplicate messages
- messages can be upto 256kb in size. can also attach instructions to access larger messages in dynamodb or s3
- 64kb is 1 billable message unit
- Lifecycle: 1. Component 1 sends message to Q and the message is redundantly distributed across SQS server. 2. When component2 is ready, it retrieves and messages becomes invisible from queue for a period of visibility timeout. 3. Component2 deletes the message after successfully processing the message
- Short polling (default) : polls only a subset of SQS servers. Continuous short polling to get all messages. Each short poll is charged, there might be empty messages and be charged
- Long polling: reduces cost as reduces number of empty messages                            
- Long polling does not return a response till a message is available or till the long poll times out
- Long polling has maximum timeout of 20 seconds
- delay queue(0sec to 12 hours): amount of time to delay the first message
- message retention period (1 minute to 14 days, default is 4 days): amount of time message will remain in queue if not deleted
- default visibility timeout 30 seconds ; can be upto 12 hours. ChangeMessageVisibility
- receive message wait time: If set > 0, then long polling is enabled. 
- Upto 120k inflight messages
- SQS does not guarantee the delivery order of the messages
- if order is important, then sequencing info can be embedded in the message
- each message has a globally unique id which sqs returns when message is delivered to the queue
- Dead letter queues are offered where one SQS can get messages from another SQS
- SQS fanning out can be done using SNS topics where messages can be fanned out to other SQS queues
- SQS Does not guarantee first in first out
- can send upto 10 attributes as metadata on each message. As name-type-value triplets
- Queue names are limited to 80 characters, should be unique within an aws account
- AWS might delete a queue if there is no activity for 30 days
- Messages cannot be shared between queues in different regions

- Common API
  * ChangeMessageVisibility : change visibility by worker 
  * ChangeMessageVisibility : for upto 10 messages
  * SetQueueAttribues/GetQueueAttributes
  * VisibilityTimeout attribute to change default visibility timeout
  * ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds (>0 for long polling) max is 20 seconds
  * DelaySeconds
  * DeleteMessageBatch: deletes multiple message
  * SentTimestamp
  * GetQueueURL : returns URL for an existing queue
  * CreateQueue, ListQueue, SendMessage, SendMessageBatch...
  * PurgeQueue to delete all messages in the queue

- SQS service access point URL : http://sqs.<region>.amazonaws.com


##Simple Work Flow Services
- Each step is a task, similar to SQS
- Task coordination and state management service
- A workflow can consist of human events, unlike SQS
- A workflow can last upto 1 year
- It guarantees the order in which activities/tasks occurs
- Domains
  * domain helps to determine the scope of work
  * multiple workflows can live inside a domain
  * workflows cannot interact with workflows in other domains
- workers and deciders
  * Activity workers - process that performs an activity in the workflow
  * Activity workers poll SWF for new tasks that they need to perform
  * Activity workers will perform the task and report back to SWF.
  * Workers can be servers on EC2 or on premise, or humans
  * workers can be run behind firewall

- Activity task is a task assigned to a worker
- Decision task tells the decider that the state has changed. It allows decider to decide next activity. 
- Decision task occurs whenever the state of workflow changes ex when task completes

- SQS vs SWF
  * SQS has best effort message order and potentially has duplicates
  * SWF guarantees execution order and uses deciders for next instructions
  * SQS messages live upto 14 days, SWF workflow can last upto 1 year
  * SWF allows synchronous or asynchronous distributed processing
  * SWF is  task oriented, whereas SQS is message oriented

- Limits
  * 10000 workflow and activity types
  * 100 SWF domains
  * 100000 open executions in a domain
  * SWF workflow can last maximum for 1 year
