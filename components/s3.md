##Simple Storage Service S3
- An AWS account can have upto 100 S3 buckets
- No limits on the number of objects stored within a bucket
- any kind of data in any format can be stored in s3
- S3 is a simple key based object store
- S3 in US Standard provided eventual consistency. In all other regions, s3 provided read-after-write consistency for PUTS of new objects and eventual consistency for overwtite PUTS and DELETES
- within a region objects are redundantly stored on multiple devices across multiple facilities
- Content MD5 and CRC are used to detct data corruption
- Cross region replication (CRR) is allowed. Enable it to replicate data across different regions. ofcouse more cost
- Event notifications can be setup in s3, messages can be sent out using SNS, SQS or lambda
- Reduced redundancy storage is provide RRS. durability is 99.99% vs 99.999999999% of standard s3
- if data lost in RRS, then 405 error. Can also setup  SNS
- S3 can host static website. Bucket name must match domain name for website hosting. 
- S3 supports own website name or website redirects

- Access control in s3 : 4 ways can be used to secure access
  * IAM policies
  * bucket policies
  * ACLs
  * Query string authentication: can create URL to s3 object which is only valid for certain time


- Bucket name restrictions
  * upper, lowercase letters, numbers periods and dashes
  * must start and end with letter or number, not period or  dash
  * minimum 3, max 63 characters
  * cannot be an IP address style name (10.2.2.1)
  * periods and dashes cannot follow each other

- S3 object size
  * minimum of 1 byte
  * maximum of 5TB
  * Object greater than 5G are required to be multipart upload api
  * largest object using PUT operation is 5G
  * for greater than 100Mb, you should consider multipart
  * can upload a file as it is being created,
  * can start or stop uploads

- Must call CompleteMultiPartUpload to reassemble the file
- S3 sorts and stores files in lexicographical order - alphabetical order. 
- So if you are reading or writing many files, then add a random hash in the begining of filename so s3 stores in different partitions. Hence throughput performance increases
- S3 allows hosting static HTML
- Route 53 can direct your domain to your bucket. But the bucket name needs to match domain name
- No subdomains using s3 buckets

- URL name <bucket-name>.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com

- Error codes 400-client side error, 500 server side error
- 404 not found : requesting bucket which does not exist
- 403 forbidden : accessing bucket for which you do not have permission
- 400 bad request : invalid bucket state
- 409 conflict: If you try to delete a bucket that is not empty
- 500 server : s3 issue

- CORS Cross Origin Resource Sharing
  * in order to load resource from another bucket, you have to enable CORS
  * In the resource bucket add CORSconfiguration and add CORSRule and specify the AllowedOrigin and AllowedMethod

- S3 Permissions: bucket permissions
  * S3 polices can be created only by the owner of the bucket
  * can allow/deny bucket level permissions
  * bucket ownership cannot be transferred
  * can allow/deny object level permission if the bucket owner is owner of object
  * Cross account management through ACLs
  * Bucket policies can only be 20kb size

- IAM policies vs bucket policies vs ACLs 
  * IAM polices are account level
  * Bucket policies are object / resource based - only by bucket owner
  * ACLs are cross account object/bucket level permissions. ACLs can be used for grantint other AWS accounts to s3 resources

- AWS gives full permissions to owners of the bucket
- However, IAM policy can deny owner of a bucket from upload/modify or list
- explicit deny always overrides an allow
- Permissions are applied to S3 ARNs
- access can be applied at object level, as each object will have ARN

- S3 Server side encryption
  * provides encryption on bucket level and object level
  * x-amz-server-side-encryption request header is added in metadata with the upload, then aws will automatically add server side encryption
  * AES 256 encryption
  * Enable SSE through console or api. Python currently does not support SSE
  * AW deals with encryption and decryption automatically
  * You can also use your own encryption keys, but then you have to manage encription and decryption
